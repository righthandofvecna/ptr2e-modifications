This module currently does the following:
- Rollable status moves (can be disabled in the settings)
- Configurable amounts of AP/skill points (base, per level, by human/pokemon, and by [Ace] trait)
- Adds custom styling for clocks named `Day Clock`, and prompts to roll for luck when the day is over
- Adds TitaniumDragoonNeo's encounter math
- Adds the exp awarding system, and a thing that holds back the xp until the player clicks "level up", and auto-evolution (disabled by default in the module settings)
- Adds perk prerequisite checking (string parsing) and auto-skill assignment if you can meet the prerequisite by increasing a skill (can be disabled in the settings)
- Prompts the gm to add a token to an encounter if you add one mid-battle
- Add settings that disable the automatic token shrinking (making the smallest automatic token a 1x1)
- Add gender field to the ImageResolver (for species changes only, not in the blueprint generation)
- A categorized skill system. This is currently hidden from the options, as it's not ready for testing (switching back and forth causes issues)
- Module compatibility for Item Piles
